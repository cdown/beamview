# beamview

beamview is a simple dual screen PDF viewer, useful for viewing notes while
presenting a Beamer presentation.

I've quickly hacked this up because I have [this
talk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon25americas/presentation/down) on
Tuesday and dspdfviewer is crashing in fantastical, bizarre ways (and pdfpc is
as usual not behaving).

We'll see if this sticks around as a longer term project or not, but for now,
it works.
